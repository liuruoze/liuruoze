### Hi, I'm Ruo-Ze Liu

I am a Ph.D. student at [Nanjing University (NJU)](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp). Before joining NJU, I was a data scientist at [CICDI China](https://www.cicdi.com/html/1/). I have led [> 5 ML open-source initiatives](https://github.com/liuruoze), receiving > 6000 GitHub stars. I specialize in building **deep reinforcement learning agents**, with applications in games, such as StarCraft I and II. 

🔭 **I mainly focus on**:

- **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning** topics to solve complex games or environments.
- **Model-based Reinforcement Learning** topics to do efficient training.

At NJU, I work with [Prof. Tong Lu](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lutong/) from [Imagine Lab](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lutong/) on deep learning and [Prof. Yang Yu](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/yuy/) from [LAMDA](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/MainPage.ashx) on reinforcement learning. 

😄 **I am open to**:

- Paper review
- Internship:  Reinforcement Learning Internship.

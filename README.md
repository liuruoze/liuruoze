### Hi. This is Ruo-Ze Liu:

I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Nanjing University (NJU)](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp) in China. Before joining NJU, I was a data scientist at [CICDI China](https://www.cicdi.com/html/1/). I have led [> 5 ML open-source projects](https://github.com/liuruoze), receiving > 6000 stars and > 2500 forks. I specialize in building **deep reinforcement learning agents** with applications in games (such as StarCraft I and II) and **computer vision systems** with applications in plate license recognition. 

ðŸ”­ **I currently focus on**:

- **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning** topics to solve complex games or environments.
- **Model-based Reinforcement Learning** topics to do efficient training.

At NJU, I work with [Prof. Tong Lu](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lutong/) from [Imagine Lab](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lutong/) on deep learning and [Prof. Yang Yu](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/yuy/) from [LAMDA](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/MainPage.ashx) on reinforcement learning. 

ðŸ˜„ **I am open to**:

- Paper review
- Internship:  Reinforcement Learning on Game AI.
